          Our task was to equip the GreenTech Retail Center with energy-efficient systems to reduce its environmental
          impact and operating costs. This involved implementing solar panels, LED lighting, and energy management
          systems to optimize energy usage and enhance the shopping experience for visitors.

        <p>
          We devised a comprehensive sustainability plan for the GreenTech Retail Center, integrating solar panels on
          the rooftop and parking structures to generate clean energy. LED lighting and smart HVAC systems were
          installed to minimize energy consumption, while advanced monitoring systems provided real-time insights into
          energy usage and performance.
