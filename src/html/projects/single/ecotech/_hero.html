          Our task was to design and implement a comprehensive solar energy system for Solar Vista Villa, focusing on
          maximizing energy production while maintaining the villa's aesthetic appeal. This involved customizing the
          solar panel layout, selecting high-performance inverters, and integrating energy storage solutions for backup
          power.
